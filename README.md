# detroit
buildingdetroit.org

current plan is to first get the data for all past sales/auctions
https://buildingdetroit.org/properties/pastlistings/

the main listing site is rendered using Javascript so BS will not be helpful
but we just need a list of the past properties from this page
once we have those, the listing pages are primarily HTML so BS will work
